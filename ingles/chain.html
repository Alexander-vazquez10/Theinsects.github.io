             <h2 class="title">Food chain</h2>
		<p>Throughout this presentation, we will explain some of these consequences and reflect on the importance of finding sustainable and balanced approaches to pest management.

	The food chain is the set of stages that a food undergoes
from its place of origin to the place of consumption. <br><br> The union between
different links would be transport <br><br> The roles played by different living beings is one of the fundamental axes that govern this balance and to which great prominence is given in the training programs that we propose. Thus, we can find decomposers, producers, herbivores, carnivores, trophic beings and plants and other essential organisms.

The food chain is made up of links. These links acquire energy by feeding on the previous species. <br><br>Food chains show the order in which some organisms feed on others in an ecosystem; how a producer is eaten by a herbivore or primary consumer, this one is ingested by a secondary consumer and this one by a tertiary one and so on until reaching the decomposers.
•Producers. Formed by those vegetables that produce energy from feeding on the sun's rays.
<br><br>
•Consumers. Composed of three levels:
<br><br>
•Omnivores. This group is made up of consumers of producers and primary consumers.
<br><br>
•Decomposers. 
When an organism or link in a food chain is eliminated or disappears, that balance is lost. Human beings do not <br><br> participate in these food chains of nature, since we are considered super predators. <br><br>
The immediately previous level will be overpopulated, because its predators no longer exist. The lower levels and <br><br> the contiguous levels will be unbalanced due to the lack of competition between that species and the one that makes up the missing link. <br><br>
The importance of the food chain lies in the fact that it reflects how the species that make up the same ecosystem are related, as well as <br><br> how they feed and transfer energy. Through the food chain, in addition, nature is kept in balance. <br><br>
