             <h2 class="title">What benficts don insects provide?</h2>
		<p>Throughout this presentation, we will explain some of these consequences and reflect on the importance of finding sustainable and balanced approaches to pest management.
          </p>
            <p>Insects, this diverse and numerous group of animals that inhabit our
planet, play a fundamental role in ecosystems and in our daily lives.
The classification of insects is based on their anatomy and distinctive
features. These arthropods are grouped in the Insecta class, which in
turn is divided into several orders, such as Coleoptera (beetles),
Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Hymenoptera (bees and wasps),
Diptera (flies and mosquitoes), among others. Each order has specific
characteristics that define its behavior, its life cycle, and its role in the
ecosystem.<br><br>
First of all, they play a crucial role in the pollination of plants. By feeding
on nectar and pollen, insects inadvertently carry pollen grains from one
flower to another, allowing reproduction and the formation of fruits and
seeds. Without insect pollination, many plant species could not
reproduce, which would have a devastating impact on the diversity of
ecosystems and food production.<br><br>
In addition to pollination, insects act as natural decomposers.
On the other hand, insects are an important source of food for other
organisms. Many birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals feed on
insects, which provide them with the nutrients they need for survival.
However, the importance of insects goes beyond their role in
ecosystems. Insects play a key role in agriculture, as some of them act
as natural predators of pests that damage crops, reducing the need for
chemical pesticides<br><br><br>

	<h2 class="title">Beneficial Insects</h2>
	<p>
	
	Pest control is necessary to keep the field, orchard and garden in perfect and fertile condition, so we are going to present some of the insects that will help make this possible.<br><br>
Praying mantis<br><br>
There is no insect that equals the praying mantis devouring insects, so you have to pay close attention to it because just as it kills insects that harm our habitat such as flies, ants or moths, they also feed on beneficial insects.
Although there are insects that can control an insect infestation, it is always advisable to consult with a team of experts. If the pest has proliferated extensively, it will be necessary to carry out other types of applications.<br><br>
Ladybug<br><br>
One of the most well-known and loved insects by all humans are ladybugs. They live practically anywhere and believe it or not, they are great predators of aphids, so much so that they only lay their eggs if they know for sure that they are in the presence of aphids.
In addition to aphids, these are predators of insects such as whiteflies, mites, spiders... And you can find them in plants with yellow flowers such as sunflowers or chrysanthemums.<br><br>
Wasps<br><br>
Wasps can become double-edged insects, they are ideal for controlling other insect pests such as whitefly or bedbugs since wasp hatchlings feed only on insect larvae. But also, if we do not control them, they can be a harmful pest for humans.<br><br>
Bees<br><br>
These small companions feed on the nectar of some flowers and pollinate the plants around them, carrying said pollen. So these are very necessary for the formation of flowers and fruits of all crops.<br><br>
